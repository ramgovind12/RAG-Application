      "1. **Dark Comedy**: This genre would allow you to explore the grim topic of suicide in a way that highlights the absurdity and irony of the situation. The failed attempts and the strange coincidence of two strangers meeting in such a manner can be used to create humor that is dark yet thought-provoking. The characters' pasts can be revealed in a series of humorous yet poignant flashbacks or conversations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Drama**: A drama would delve deep into the emotional and psychological aspects of the characters. You can explore their past traumas, the reasons behind their suicide attempts, and their journey towards healing and redemption. The narrative can focus on their growing friendship or brotherhood as they help each other overcome their personal demons.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Thriller/Mystery**: In this genre, the coincidental meeting could be a mystery that unravels a larger conspiracy or a shared past that the characters were unaware of. Their failed suicide attempts could be a clue to a bigger puzzle. The narrative can focus on uncovering the truth behind their pasts and the strange coincidence that brought them together.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Romance (Bromance)**: While it might not be the most obvious choice, a bromance could blossom from this unlikely meeting. The two characters could form a deep bond as they help each other overcome their pasts and look towards a brighter future. The narrative can focus on their growing friendship and the positive impact they have on each other's lives.\n",
